# MAPPO-PTBA
**Video Demonstration Description:**
The accompanying videos demonstrate the microscopic decision-making behaviors of MAPPO, MAPPO-Pred, and MAPPO-PTBA algorithms under the same high-conflict merging scenario to further illustrate their respective performance differences. In this scenario, vehicle $v_2$ in lane 2 is initially aligned with vehicle $v_8$ in lane 3, creating a merging conflict as $v_8$ attempts to enter the main lane.
**Video 1 (MAPPO):** Vehicle $v_2$ adheres strictly to its learned policy and continues occupying lane 2 without yielding, blocking $v_8$'s merging attempt. At time step 10, $v_2$ initiates a lane change to lane 1 but lacks sufficient headway from the preceding vehicle $v_3$, causing oscillatory motion. This forces $v_3$ to abruptly change lanes, ultimately leading to a lateral collision with $v_8$, which attempts to merge during the disturbance.
**Video 2 (MAPPO-Pred):** Vehicle $v_2$ maintains its lane but accelerates to mitigate the conflict with $v_8$. While this reduces the direct obstruction, the following vehicle $v_3$ remains a bottleneck. As a result, $v_8$ is unable to merge safely and is forced to stop at the end of the acceleration lane. Although no collision occurs, the prolonged hesitation poses significant safety risks in real-world scenarios.
**Video 3 (MAPPO-PTBA):** The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior adaptability. At time step 7, vehicle $v_2$ proactively changes to lane 1, effectively clearing the path for $v_8$. This cooperative maneuver enables $v_8$ to complete the merge smoothly without disrupting the flow of surrounding vehicles. The sequence highlights MAPPO-PTBAâ€™s enhanced foresight and risk-aware planning capabilities.
The videos clearly visualize how different coordination strategies affect the merging outcome, further validating the safety and efficiency advantages of the MAPPO-PTBA framework.
